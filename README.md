## Getting Started

Welcome to our `CS101 - Python for Beginners` codespace environment. This codespace is powered by `alpine`, a lightweight Docker image based on Alpine Linux that covers limited features sufficiently enough for submitting tasks. 

##### Installed packages
- `python3`
- `vim`

##### Deprecated features
- `apk` (Package installation is not allowed.)
- `pip` (Package installation is not allowed.)
- `bash`

#### Run your first `Hello world` program
To run your first python program, execute this at your home directory.
```
python3 src/hello.py
```
Now, you should see
```
